# OpenDXL-filesearchtag

This solution leverages OpenDXL to issue MAR Searches using a list of hashes in a file as the source. Each hash is searched for, and each system that matches is tagged in McAfee ePO with a user-definable tag. This tag can be used to quarantine a node and/or be used to initiate additional workflows.
